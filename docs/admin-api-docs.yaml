    This is an **example** API to demonstrate features of the OpenAPI
    specification.

    # Introduction

    This API definition is intended to to be a good starting point for
    describing your API in [OpenAPI/Swaggerformat](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md).
    It also demonstrates features of the
    [create-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Redocly/create-openapi-repo) tool and
    the [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc) documentation engine. Beyond
    the standard OpenAPI syntax, we use a few [vendor extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).

    # OpenAPI Specification

    The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard,
    language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which
    allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities
    of the service without access to source
    code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly
    defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what
    interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the
    guesswork in calling the service.
